    {
      "id": "lit_1",
      "query": "What are the main mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing?",
      "expected_answer": "CRISPR-Cas9 uses a guide RNA to direct the Cas9 nuclease to a specific DNA sequence, where it creates a double-strand break. The cell's repair mechanisms then either disrupt the gene (NHEJ) or insert new genetic material (HDR).",
